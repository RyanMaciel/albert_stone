    <h1 class="title">University of Rochester History</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Prince Street Campus</h1>
    <p>Arthur James May provides a comprehensive history of University of Rochester in his 1977 Manuscript, A History of the University of Rochester. The following is a summary of the University’s history up to its movement to the Prince Street Campus, largely summarizing May’s work, followed by an exploration of the Prince Street Campus using the Stone Negative Collection.

    <p>The historical record first hints at the founding of the University of Rochester in an anonymous 1844 letter. This letter mentions that "the establishment of a university in this city has lately been made the subject of conversation," (1,Chpt. 1) and describes briefly the details of how such an institution might function. From this point, several religious leaders and institutions got involved with the conversation about the founding of a new educational institution in Rochester. Many framed this conversation in terms of local interest and development, noting that the cost to travel east towards more established institutions was prohibitively expensive in many cases. Reverend Doctor Chester Dewey writes that “‘every farmer in Western New York in comfortable circumstances’ would be able to finance the education of one or more of his sons at Rochester” were a university built there. (1, Chpt. 1)
      </p>
    <p>In 1846 many towns around Rochester petitioned the New York State Legislature to pass an act to create the University of Rochester. On May 8th of the same year, the act was passed and a corps of trustees was formed. The act stipulated that a school with at least two professors and a chief executive officer must form within three years. In order to meet this goal, the trustees went about fundraising. They sought 100 dollar donations, each of which would secure tuition for one student. By 1847, it seems the fundraising effort had fallen short and the campaign petered out for the time being. (1, Chpt. 2)
      </p>
    <p>Efforts were rejuvenated however, by events at Madison College, in Hamilton, NY, over 100 miles to the east. This college was already established and functional, graduating its first class in 1822. However, many students, professors and administrators involved with the school felt that the small village of Hamilton was stifling the success of the institution. Many argued for the college to be moved to a more urban environment, closer to modern means of transportation such as the railroad. One of the chief candidates for a new location was Rochester. (1, Chpt. 2)
      </p>
    <p>Many in Rochester and at Madison were vocal proponents of this plan. However, an equally raucous group campaigned for the college to remain in Hamilton. In order to support their side, Rochesterians began fundraising anew and by December, 1847 reported having raised between $50,000 and $60,000 dollars for the move. In August of 1848, the debate came to a head when the Baptist Education Society, the owner of Madison College held their annual sessions. “Disputation ebbed and flowed but in the end, after dubious, astute maneuvering "the western movement" captured majority support: Madison University would be transferred to the city on the Genesee, if and when legal obstacles were hurdled” (1, Chpt. 2)
      </p>
    <p>However, these legal obstacles proved too difficult to overcome. Hamiltonians applied to the Supreme Court for an injunction against the college move which was granted temporarily in January 1849 and then permanently in April of 1850. When it became clear that the move was not possible, proponents of an institution at Rochester quickly moved to establish a separate college. In January of 1850, leaders of the Rochester project petitioned the Regents of the University of the State of New York for a provisional charter to establish the University of Rochester. On January 31, 1850, the charter was issued, with an initial funding goal of $130,000. (1, Chpt. 2) This goal was reached in reasonable time and the University acquired a lease from the United States Temperance Hotel. On Tuesday, November 5, 1850 the University began teaching to about 60 undergraduates. (1, Chpt. 4)

    <p>In 1853, a local businessman, Azariah Boody, donated 8 acres of land on Prince Street near East Avenue, then on the outskirts of the city. The University accepted this donation and purchased an additional 17 acres at $1,000 an acre to establish the Prince Street Campus. Development of the property for academic purposes was slow, but by 1861, the campus was ready for learners. (1, Chpt. 6) This campus was the site of the University until the men’s college was moved to the River Campus in 1930 and the women’s college followed in 1955 (3). Several buildings that were part of the original Prince Street Campus are either no longer standing or are radically different from their original state. We can explore the history of this location and its built environment through the Albert R. Stone Negative Collection. This exploration serves as a small case study in how the collection might be used to support other historical research in Rochester.

    <h2 class="subtitle">Sibley Hall</h2>
    <div class="dynamic_image_card" accNum="40.332.28"></div>
    <p>Sibley Hall, constructed in 1877, was the first fireproof structure in Rochester, featuring an air gap between outer masonry and the inner brickwork (4). It served as a library and museum until 1955 and was demolished in 1968. The sphinxes adorning the front entrance of the library were frequent targets for mischievous graffiti by undergraduate classes. A librarian for the college in the late 1920’s, Donald B. Gilchrist, was quoted by Campus, the university's newspaper: 
    </p>
    <p class="bqoute"> “If they want to live in a pig-pen, why, let them. But you know, this is only a cheap attempt. The best job that I remember was done a few years ago in connection with a class battle. Black was the only color used, but that was wonderful paint. The eyes were circled, the ribs outlined, and paint was liberally applied on all the other features. It took two sandblasting crews to get that paint off and it cost the sophomore class about $250.” (5)
      </p>
    <p> When the university moved to the River Campus, the sphinxes came along as well. They continue to greet students heading to classes up to today, placed at one of the entrances to the tunnel system under Eastman Quad. 
    </p>

    <div class="dynamic_image_card" accNum="40.332.8493"></div>
    
    <p>Sibley hall was a gift from Hiram Sibley, who also oversaw the building’s construction. Sibley commissioned eight statues from Italy to adorn the alcoves on the sides of the building (4). Two of these were lost in transit from Europe. The statues were themed along 8 areas of knowledge, and those eventually delivered to the campus were Astronomy, Geography, Industry, Navigation, Commerce and Science. The first four of these were stored at the Memorial Art Gallery after the college moved to the River Campus. The Science statue had deteriorated significantly in its original outdoor settings and was lost (5). Commerce was kept in storage as well, although the location of the facility is unknown. It was slated to be destroyed in 1977, and was offered to James Carley, a former English professor at the University of Rochester. Carley accepted and kept the statue in his yard at his Toronto home until 2013, when he gifted the statue back to the university (6). It now stands at the end of Dewey Hall at the River Campus.

      The four statues kept at the Memorial Art Gallery were restored and reinstalled outdoors at the River Campus in 1978 for the 25th reunion gift of the class of 1954. They now stand near Rush Rhees Library, just outside Meliora Hall.

    <h2 class="subtitle">Catharine Strong Hall</h2>
    <div class="dynamic_image_card" accNum="40.332.7477"></div>
    <p>According to the notes from RMSC, Catharine Strong Hall “contained an auditorium, classrooms, administrative offices, a small library, and a lunchroom.” Built in 1914, it still stands at 31 Prince Street today. It is no longer part of the University, but now houses SUNY Brockport’s Visual Studies Workshop. According to an exhibit on the history of the University of Rochester, “Smoking pipes, planting ivy, singing songs, burning the class will, and passing under daisy chain arches have all been part of class day and commencement customs.” Many of these customs occurred at Catharine Strong Hall (8). In one, students carried Daisy Arches from Anthony Memorial Hall to Catharine Strong Hall. “The sophomore women of the University of Rochester, the traditional makers and bearers of the daisy chains, are all dressed in white.”

    <div class="dynamic_image_card" accNum="40.332.1991"></div>

    <p>Another was the planting of the class ivy. According to the notes accompanying this image, a student would give the &ldquo;Ivy Oration&rdquo; at the class day ceremonies and then plant ivy. In this case, it was planted against one of the walls of Catharine Strong Hall.
    </p>
    <div class="dynamic_image_card" accNum="40.332.1961"></div>

    <p class="c2"> The burning of the class will is also covered in the Stone collection. Little detail on this ceremony is given in the notes accompanying the image, however it seems to be another that took place near the hall.

    <h2 class="subtitle">The Flag Rush</h2>

    

    <p>The last major class tradition covered by the Stone Collection is the "Flag Rush." According to the notes of the below images, "In the flag rush, the sophomores try to protect a 'flag' that they have nailed to the top of a greased pole, while the freshmen attempt to capture it." This intense version of capture the flag involved large groups of students throwing objects including rotten eggs, flour, tomatoes and more to attack and defend. It appears that this event got quite rough considering the following images of some of the aftermath.

    <h2 class="subtitle">SATC Temporary Barracks</h2>

    <div class="dynamic_image_card" accNum="40.332.1935"></div>

    <p>During World War 1 the University of Rochester participated in the Student Army Training Corps (SATC). These temporary barracks were built at the Prince Street Campus, breaking ground on September 28, 1918 (9). They were meant to house soldiers who could not fit in Carnegie Hall and the Alumni Gym, which had been converted to barracks (10). However, with the war ending less than two months later on November 11th, the use seems to have been fairly limited. The structures were demolished shortly after according to photo notes.
