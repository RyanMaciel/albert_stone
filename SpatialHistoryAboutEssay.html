  <p class="c5"><span class="c3">About</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c4">This project is a spatially informed exploration of the Albert R. Stone Negative Collection, held at the Rochester Museum &amp; Science Center (RMSC). Stone worked as a staff photographer at The Democrat and Chronicle from 1904 to 1936. According to the New York Heritage Digital Collections website, the photographs have a wide range of subjects related to the Rochester area, especially documenting the construction of the Erie Barge Canal and the Rochester Subway. There are about fourteen thousand photographs in the collection and nearly all of them have high quality text descriptions of the images&rsquo; contents and general notes about what is depicted attached. Through a process of mining these images and metadata from the RMSC online catalogue, I have been able to geolocate many of the images on a map of the Rochester area.</span></p><p class="c1 c6"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The hope in this work is that presenting the images in a new context will yield new insights into the history of the development of Rochester, as well as reveal a historical overlay on contemporary places. Thus, the project can serve two types of users: those who are interested in the visual culture of Rochester in the early twentieth century from a historical perspective, and those who might just be interested in the history of their neighborhood or local area in Rochester. By implementing a user-friendly mapping interface that can show rich data without being overwhelming, both user groups can benefit. </span></p></body></html>
