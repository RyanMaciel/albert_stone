      <h2 class="subtitle">Construction</h2>
      <p>Albert Stone is noted for having a special photographic interest in the grand construction projects that were happening in Rochester at the time he was working. One of the most significant of these projects was the construction of the Veterans Memorial Bridge completed in December, 1931. The bridge spans the Genesee river about one mile North of lower falls with a length of 981 feet. One newspaper reported &ldquo;Its attractiveness is increase [sic] by the natural scenic beauty of the lower river, the span being in one of the most picturesque sections of the Genesee gorge.&rdquo; (1) The bridge was constructed out of granite-faced concrete and has a total of seven arches spanning the Genesee.

      <p>
        
Other historical sources document the visual aspects of the bridge’s construction. Carl W. Peters was an American Painter from Fairport, New York. He received his artistic education at Rochester Mechanics Institute (now the Rochester Institute of Technology) and went on to paint several murals in Rochester for the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s (3). He painted the below scene from the construction of the Veterans Memorial Bridge in 1930. The composition is very similar to the image above (Acc. Number 40.332.142.) and was probably created from a similar vantage point. Peters’ viewing seems to have occurred earlier than the above photograph, as the photograph has an additional arch and semi-completed middle tower.

        Gallery label text from the Memorial Art Gallery, which holds Peters’ painting, recounts events at the dedication of the bridge. A representative of the Gold Star Mothers, who had lost their sons in World War I, gave the following speech:
        </p>

        <br/>
        <p>"Great bridges across flowing waters are</p>
        <p>indicative of the continual labors of life.</p>
        <p>In the very presence of continual change,</p>
        <p>they seem to connect the past with the</p>
        <p>present, even as they connect the East</p>
        <p>with the West, the North with the South..." (2)</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Documenting Workers</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to documenting the bridge itself under different stages of construction, Albert Stone paid particular attention to the workers building the bridge. Before construction even began he took images of the surveyors at work. (40.332.4265) He also took several photographs of concrete workers whose names and addresses are noted in several image descriptions.

      <h2 class="subtitle">Surrounding Demolition</h2>
      <p>The last interesting factor in the construction of the bridge is that a significant amount of demolition had to be done in order to clear space for roads to connect to the bridge. The notes on several images from surrounding areas around the time of the bridge construction indicate that many were condemned for demolition. This documentation gives us a street-level glimpse of the neighborhood before it was disturbed. The rich historical content of the collection gives us this unique and personal perspective that would have otherwise been represented only by the absence of a few buildings on a map.
