      <h1 class="title">Veterans Memorial Bridge Construction.<h1>

      <p>Albert Stone is noted for having a special photographic interest in the grand construction projects that were happening in Rochester at the time he was working. One of the most significant of these projects was the construction of the Veterans Memorial Bridge completed in December, 1931. The bridge spans the Genesee river about one mile North of lower falls with a length of 981 feet. One newspaper reported &ldquo;Its attractiveness is increase [sic] by the natural scenic beauty of the lower river, the span being in one of the most picturesque sections of the Genesee gorge.&rdquo; (1) The bridge was constructed out of granite-faced concrete and has a total of seven arches spanning the Genesee. At the dedication of the bridge, the president of World War I Gold Star Mothers said following:
        <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Great bridges across flowing waters are</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">indicative of the continual labors of life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the very presence of continual change,</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">they seem to connect the past with the</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">present, even as they connect the East</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">with the West, the North with the South...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">(2)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>

      <p>The notes on an image numbered 40.332.746 indicate that a significant amount of demolition had to be done in order to clear space for roads to connect to the bridge. The following investigates area near the bridge that was lost due to its construction.
